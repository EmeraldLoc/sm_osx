## About Me
I am a swift programmer who enjoys playing video games. I started when I was very young, and since then have learned the swift programming language, and I have loved it ever since I started programming in swift. I also program in lua, c#, am decent at c, and have done a little bit of js.

## How this project got started
Super Mario 64 was one of the first  of 3 games I played, however I forgot about it for a couple of years until I learned about decomp and the sm64 pc port. Ever since I heard about it, I wanted to play the game at 60fps widescreen, however, on my mac, with no easy way to do it, I realized I would have to make my own way. So after collecting a lot of knowledge about Makefiles and a bit about compilers, I was able to tinker up a small, but usable app. I then released the first version of sm_osx. Only including a couple of repos, it was the start of this project.

## Getting started
You can download sm_osx [here](https://github.com/EmeraldLoc/sm_osx/releases/latest/download/sm_osx.zip).

Note: while sm_osx should install homebrew for you, you will need to enter your password once if your on intel, and twice if your on arm.
